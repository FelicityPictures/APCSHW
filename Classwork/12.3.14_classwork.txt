I tested my insertionSort() method creating an array, printing
it, and then using insertionSort. The resulting array was in
alphabetical order, showing that my insertionSort() method worked.

In order to test the two insertionSort methods, I created two
identical arrays and used a different insertionSort method for
each array.
